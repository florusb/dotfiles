dotfiles.git
============
My dotfiles. Based on idea from startup engineering coursera.org course

See also http://github.com/startup-class/setup to install prerequisite
programs. If all goes well, in addition to a more useful prompt, now you can
do `emacs -nw hello.js` and hitting `C-c!` to launch an interactive SSJS
REPL, among many other features. See the
[Startup Engineering Video Lectures 4a/4b](https://class.coursera.org/startup-001/lecture/index)
for more details.
